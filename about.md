# Background

I'm a Research Associate at the University of Oxford working in energy storage modelling and testing. My research aims to improve parameter estimation and optimisation frameworks for next-generation lithium batteries. Rapid parameterisation and optimisation of open-source battery models is an ongoing challenge to advance battery design and lifetime in order to meet global climate goals. This includes the development of Bayesian techniques for non-destructive, data-driven parameterisation of physics-informed models.

During my PhD, my research aims were in advanced, open-source,Â physics-informed modelling techniques to enable improvements in cell cycle life and performance. 

Before this, I worked as a controls engineer at AVL North America, in addition to multiple internships along the way.
