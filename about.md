# Background

I'm a Research Fellow at Oxford Brookes University working in energy storage modelling and testing. My research interests lie in fast physics-informed applied mathematics. I use techniques from control theory and scientific machine learning to study advancements in battery management, and next-generation electrochemical cell design. 

During my PhD and postdoctoral career my main research aims have been in advanced, open-source,Â physics-informed modelling techniques to enable improvements in cell cycle-life and performance. 

Before this, I worked as a controls engineer at AVL North America in addition to multiple internships along the way.
